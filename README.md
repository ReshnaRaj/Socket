# Socket
Socket.io is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients (such as web browsers) and servers.
It provides a simple and effective way to establish a persistent connection between the server and clients, 
allowing data to be transmitted in real-time without the need for continuous polling.

Actually this is the application where user is sending data to another user in stead of sending the response from backend to frontend
